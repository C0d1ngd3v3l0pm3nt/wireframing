# Wireframing
Wireframing is the process by which a blueprint or a skeletal framework of an app is created. This design is what is used to inform design choices ofan app or a website.

## Key elements of a wireframe
- **Layout structure**-This informs the arrangemeny of various elements on a page
- **Navigation**-This shows users how they will move through an app or a website
- **Content placement**-Indicates where different icons and content will be placed
- **Functionality**-Otlines key elements and interactions

  ## Types of wireframes
  ### Low fidelity wireframes
  - Low fidelity is the most basic type of wireframing. Itâ€™s so simplistic, that paper and pen will still suffice as a way to represent your idea.
  - Low fidelity wireframes are done in grayscale with a focus on layout and high-level interactions. UI elements and content are represented by basic shapes like squares, triangles, circles, and line
  ### High fidelity wireframes
  - High fidelity wireframes include visual markers and branding signifiers like colors, graphics, and font style.
  - UI elements look realistic and might even include textures and shadow
  - More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.
 
## Wireframing Tools
- There are different tools that can be used for wireframing. Some of them include:
   1. Figma
   2. Sketch
   3. Adobe XD
- These tools are popular for various reasons. Sketch is popular because of its usability on MacOS systems. Adobe XD on the other hand offers seamless integrations with other Adobe applications making it easier to work on projects on different apps.
- The most popular app in use is Figma because of the following reasons
  1. It is a cloud based application and thus allows for members of a team to work collaboratively on the same project. This makes it easier work from different places.
  2. Figma can be accessed from different platforms and operating systems.
  3. Figma offers a free plan for individual users making it the most ideal choice for freelancers and people who wireframe as a hobby
  4. Figma has an auto layout feature that makes it easier to design aan application or website for different devices.
  5. Figma offers a designer the ability to wireframe, design and prototype a design on the same platform.
  6. Figma has many different plugins which make it easier to tailor it to suit the needs of a specific user.
     
## Benefits of wireframing
- Wireframing helps translate concepts and abstract ideas into tangible presentations. This helps designers and stakeholders visualize the layout of the product.
- Helps facilitate collaboration in a team since all the stakeholders and designers communicate and get to be on the same page about design decisions.
- Helps identify usability issues which can include navigation issues, hierachy issues and interaction flaws.
- Saves time and resources since it reduces the possibility of errors and help focus time on what needs to be worked on.
- Enables easy modifications that encourage experimentation and iterrative development.
- Helps focus the designers' attention to functionality and usability as well as the user experience.
